# INFOTC 2600 Final Project: Digital Displays
## Marissa Watkins

The purpose of this tutorial is to inform people about digial displys technology has to offer. This will provide information on panel technology, form factor, resolution, aspect ratio, and much more. 

Note: This tutorial is for people who are interested in learning more about the digital displays they use in their everyday lives; televisions, computer monitors, mobile phones, and even themostats. The level of knowledge on digital displays is little, having some background within technology might be useful to understand some of the topics. 

## Where are digital displays seen?

It is shocking how often we come across digital displays throughout our daily lives. From watching televistions to looking at our cell phones and even in some cases, when we go to the refrigerator to grab something to eat. 
The following links will give you an insight about the digital displays we see everyday. 
* [Televisions](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/hdtv.htm)
* [Computer monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor)
* [Digital cinema projectors](https://www.christiedigital.com/en-us/cinema/cinema-products/digital-cinema-projectors)
* [Digital signage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signage)
* [Mobile phones](https://www.lifewire.com/cell-phone-displays-577490)
* [Tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer)
* [Watches](https://wearos.google.com/#hands-free-help)
* [Thermostats](http://www.archiexpo.com/prod/lennox/product-147436-1936595.html)
* [Refrigerators](https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/family-hub-refrigerator/overview/)

Next we will be looking at Panel Technology
## Panel Displays 
The following are links to the various types of panel technology

* [Plasma Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_display)
* [Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display)
* [Light Emitting Diode Display (LED)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_display)
* [Organic Light-Emitting Diode Display (OLED)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED)
* [Quantanum Dot Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot_display)
* [Electronic Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper)

## Form Factor
From flat and rectangular to [curved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_screen) and round.

Curved screen displays were introduced around 2014 by Samsung and LG. The screens supposedly create a better immersive experience. The down side to curved tv's, there is one "sweet spot" for viewing meaning people sitting in any other positions will experience a degraded picture quality. 

Along curved tv's are curved phones. Samsung released a [phone that has rounded edges](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-s8/). 

Other examples of non-traditional rectangular displays
* [Amazon Echo Spot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_daynBbEFB16YD)
* [Android Wear Watches](https://wearos.google.com/#hands-free-help)
* Apples [iPhone X](https://www.apple.com/iphone/)

## Resolution
[Display resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution) is the number of pixels across by the number of rows of pixels

![alt text](https://github.com/marissawatkins/INFOTC2600FinalProject/blob/master/resolution.png)

A full high definition (FHD) display is 1920 by 1080. This means there are 1920 pixels across and 1080 rows of pixels. This type of display has 1920 * 1080 = 2,073,600 pixels.

Interesting read : [Screen resolution and Aspect Ratio](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/what-screen-resolution-or-aspect-ratio-what-do-720p-1080i-1080p-mean)

* 1080p refers to a 1920 by 1080 resolution that is displayed progressively.
* 1080i refers to a 1920 by 1080 resolution that is displayed interlaced.

Televisions that support FullHD (1920 x 1080) have been the mainstay for a number of years now. Ultra-high definiton (UHD) is the next step up in resolution for consumer TVs and is the current state of the art. Sometimes UHD is referred to as 4K, but it isnâ€™t fully 4K.
