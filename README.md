# INFOTC 2600 Final Project: Digital Displays
## Marissa Watkins

The purpose of this tutorial is to inform people about digial displys technology has to offer. This will provide information on panel technology, form factor, resolution, aspect ratio, and much more. 

This tutorial is for people who are interested in learning more about the digital displays they use in their everyday lives; televisions, computer monitors, mobile phones, and even themostats. The level of knowledge on digital displays is little, having some background within technology might be useful to understand some of the topics.
