# INFOTC 2600 Final Project: Digital Displays
## Marissa Watkins

The purpose of this tutorial is to inform people about digial displys technology has to offer. This will provide information on panel technology, form factor, resolution, aspect ratio, and much more. 

Note: This tutorial is for people who are interested in learning more about the digital displays they use in their everyday lives; televisions, computer monitors, mobile phones, and even themostats. The level of knowledge on digital displays is little, having some background within technology might be useful to understand some of the topics. 

## Where are digital displays seen?

It is shocking how often we come across digital displays throughout our daily lives. From watching televistions to looking at our cell phones and even in some cases, when we go to the refrigerator to grab something to eat. 
The following links will give you an insight about the digital displays we see everyday.

### Plasma Display:

![alt text](https://github.com/marissawatkins/INFOTC2600FinalProject/blob/master/plasmaDisplay.png)

#### Plasma TV Advantages
* Wider [contrast ratio](https://www.lifewire.com/tv-contrast-ratio-3276368)
* Ability to display depth and range
* Better motion tracking response time due to the implementation of [Sub Field Drive technology](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-sub-field-drive-1847853)
* More color depth and range
* Wider viewing angle than LCD

#### Plasma TV Disadvantages
* More susceptibility to burn-in (This is not as much of a factor on more recent models due to improvements, such as "pixel orbiting")
* More heat generation (as well as more power consumption)
* Does not perform as well at higher altitudes
* Naturally darker image and screen glare in brightly lit rooms
* Heavier weight (when comparing equivalent screen sizes), and more delicate to ship
* Not available with 4K resolution

### LCD:

![alt text](https://github.com/marissawatkins/INFOTC2600FinalProject/blob/master/lcd-screen.gif)

#### LCD TV Advantages
* No pixel burn-in susceptibility, although non-permanent image persistence is sometimes observed if the same image in on the screen for extended periods
* Cooler running temperature
* Typically has less screen glare unless the screen is curved
* More functional at high altitudes
* Longer display life
* Looks better in brightly lit rooms due to the ability to produce a naturally brighter image (this also allows for the implementation of HDR)
* Lower power consumption
* Typically lighter weight 

#### LCD TV Disadvantages
* Lower contrast ratio
* Now as good displaying deep blacks
* Narrower side-to-side viewing angle
* Not as good at tracking motion. This has improved implementation of [120Hz and 240Hz refresh rates](https://www.lifewire.com/video-frame-vs-screen-refresh-rate-1847855) and additional motion processing. 
* Although LCD TVs do not burn-in, individual pixels can burn out, causing small, visible, black or white dots to appear on the screen. Due to this, the individual pixels cannot be repaired meaning that the whole screen may need to be replaced
* Usually more expensive than an equivalent-sized Plasma TV. 

### LED:

![alt text](https://github.com/marissawatkins/INFOTC2600FinalProject/blob/master/LEDDisplay.jpg)

#### LED TV Advantages
* Better picture quality; The black levels are improved and will see blackest colors. 
* They consume less energy compared to LCD TVs. There is almost 50% reduction in the power consumption for LED TVs, meaning they are energy efficient.
* The contrast is much better in LED TVs compared to LCD
* Life span is longer
* Mercury is not used for lighting the display panel

#### LED TV Disadvantages
* A bit more expensive when comparing prices to a LCD TV or a plasma TV. 
* It is difficult to mount the LED TV on the wall as they have more dimensional depth
* Compared to plasma TVs, LED TVs do not have better contrast ratio.

### OLED:

![alt text](https://github.com/marissawatkins/INFOTC2600FinalProject/blob/master/oled-cell.gif)

#### OLED TV Advantages
* The plastic, organic layers of an OLED are thinner, lighter and more flexible than the crystalline layers in an LED or LCD
* Since the light-emitting layers are lighter, the substrate of an OLED can be flexible instead of rigid. 
* OLEDs are brighter than LEDs. This is because of the organic layers are much thinning than the corresponding inorganic crystal layers of an LED. 
* Backlighting like LCDs are not required meaning they consume much less power.
* Large fields of view, about 170 degrees. OLEDs produce their own light, so they have a much wider viewing range.

#### OLED TV Disadvantages
* While red and green OLED films have longer lifetimes (46,000 to 230,000 hours), blue organics currently have much short lifetimes (up to around 14,000 hours).
* Because manufacturing processes are expensive, it causes the TVs to be more as well.
* Easily damaged by water

## Form Factor
From flat and rectangular to [curved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_screen) and round. 

![alt text](https://github.com/marissawatkins/INFOTC2600FinalProject/blob/master/curvedTV.jpg)

Curved screen displays were introduced around 2014 by Samsung and LG. The screens supposedly create a better immersive experience. The down side to curved tv's, there is one "sweet spot" for viewing meaning people sitting in any other positions will experience a degraded picture quality. 

Along curved tv's are curved phones. Samsung released a [phone that has rounded edges](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-s8/). 

Other examples of non-traditional rectangular displays
* [Amazon Echo Spot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_daynBbEFB16YD)
* [Android Wear Watches](https://wearos.google.com/#hands-free-help)
* Apples [iPhone X](https://www.apple.com/iphone/)

## Resolution
[Display resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution) is the number of pixels across by the number of rows of pixels

![alt text](https://github.com/marissawatkins/INFOTC2600FinalProject/blob/master/resolution.png)

A full high definition (FHD) display is 1920 by 1080. This means there are 1920 pixels across and 1080 rows of pixels. This type of display has 1920 * 1080 = 2,073,600 pixels.

Interesting read : [Screen resolution and Aspect Ratio](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/what-screen-resolution-or-aspect-ratio-what-do-720p-1080i-1080p-mean)

* 1080p refers to a 1920 by 1080 resolution that is displayed progressively.
* 1080i refers to a 1920 by 1080 resolution that is displayed interlaced.

Televisions that support FullHD (1920 x 1080) have been the mainstay for a number of years now. Ultra-high definiton (UHD) is the next step up in resolution for consumer TVs and is the current state of the art. Sometimes UHD is referred to as 4K, but it isn’t fully 4K.

* [UHD Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television) are 3840x2160 pixels.
* [4k Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution)
* Note that Ultra-high defintion (UHD) refers to the "4k" used for consumer television. Full 4k (DCI 4K) refers to the full 4K resolution often used in digital cinema.

Why is the 4K used for consumer TV (UHD) at a slightly lower resolution than DCI 4K? Answer: aspect ratio. UHD has the same aspect ratio as FHD. This means that older HD TVs have the same aspect ratio as newer UHD TVs which is 16:9. DCI 4K has an aspect ratio of 256∶135 or ≈1.90∶1. An image produced for the 16:9 aspect ratio will not nicely fit on a display with a 256∶135 or ≈1.90∶1 aspect ratio. They did it so the content produced prior to the next generation of high resolution consumer displays fits nicely on these new displays.

## Contrast Ratio
The [contrast ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_ratio) is a property of a display system, defined as the ratio of the luminance of the brightest color (white) to that of the darkest color (black) that the system is capable of producing. A high contrast ratio is a desired aspect of any display. It has similarities with dynamic range.

## Brightness
The amount of light that a display panel generates varies between displays. Just like different light bulbs can generate different levels of brightness, different monitors can produce different levels of maximum brightness. The ability to view a display in a brightly lit room or in sunlight depends on the brightness the display can achieve. Generally brighter displays cost more and, of course, produce better viewing results in brightly lit settings.

Brightness is [measured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_per_square_metre) in nits(nt) or candela per meter squared (cd/m^2). 1 nt = 1 cd/m2

## Gamma
In computer image processing, the term [gamma](https://www.eizo.com/library/basics/lcd_display_gamma/) gernerally refers to the brightness of intermediate tones (gray).

## Why Digital Systems has importance
Digital systems plays a key role in the modern era as they are used in various applications in all fields of human activity. On the other hand, digital technique is a blueprint for an organization's digital authentic estate. Companies represent their data in the form of a digital system, irrespective of whether it is in video, graphic design, internet design and style.
